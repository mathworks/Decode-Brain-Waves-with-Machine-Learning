# Decode-Brain-Waves-with-Machine-Learning
This repository contains an activity where students will learn how to interpret EEG signals and practice labeling data by hand. Then, they will build and test a simple machine learning model in MATLAB using the k-nearest neighbor algorithm to classify EEG data automatically and compare its accuracy to their own predictions.
